## üî¨ **Theory ‚Äì Cell Conductance (G = I / V)**

**Conductance (G)** is a fundamental electrical property that quantifies how easily electric current flows through a material when a voltage is applied. It is the reciprocal of resistance (R), and is expressed by the relation:

$$
G = \frac{I}{V}
$$

Where:

* $G$ = Conductance (in Siemens, S)
* $I$ = Current (in Amperes, A)
* $V$ = Voltage (in Volts, V)

This relationship implies that for a constant voltage, an increase in current indicates higher conductance, and vice versa.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Working Principle of the Simulator**

The simulator visually represents this concept using interactive components:

1. **Voltage and Current Inputs**: Users can select or input voltage and current values by interacting with a chart. These values are used to simulate an electrical experiment.

2. **Beaker Representation**:

   * **Current Beaker**: Shows the magnitude of the current as a liquid level.
   * **Voltage Beaker**: Represents applied voltage similarly.
   * **Conductance Beaker**: Dynamically adjusts to show the resulting conductance calculated from the input values.

3. **Calculation**:
   Upon clicking the **Simulate** button, the simulator computes conductance using the formula $G = \frac{I}{V}$ and displays the result in Siemens (S).

4. **Data Visualization**:
   A chart is used both to input values and display conductance trends, offering a visual understanding of how conductance varies with changes in voltage and current.

### üìä **Educational Value**

This simulator is particularly useful for:

* High school and undergraduate physics or electronics students.
* Demonstrating real-time calculations and data visualization.
* Reinforcing the mathematical relationship between current, voltage, and conductance.
