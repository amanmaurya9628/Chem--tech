Theory in Current and Voltage Form
Cell conductance of a solution can be directly related to Ohm’s Law, which states:

I.R=V=R.I

Where:
V = Voltage applied across the solution (volts)

I = Current passing through the solution (amperes)

R = Resistance of the solution (ohms)

Conductance (G)
Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance:

𝐺=1/R

So from Ohm’s law:

𝐺=I/V

This shows that the conductance of a solution can be experimentally determined by applying a known voltage and measuring the resulting current:

Conductance=Current(I)/Voltage(v)

Specific Conductance (κ) and Cell Constant (K)
To relate measured conductance to the intrinsic property of the solution:

𝜅=K.G=K.I/V

Where:

κ = Specific conductance (S/cm)

K = Cell constant = l/A   (cm⁻¹)


I = Current (A)

V = Voltage (V)

### Practical Measurement

1.Apply a small AC voltage across two electrodes immersed in the solution.

2.Measure the resulting current.

3.Calculate resistance:

𝑅=V/I

 
Determine conductance:

𝐺=1/R=I/V

 
Use cell constant 
𝐾
K to find specific conductance:

𝜅=K.I/v
