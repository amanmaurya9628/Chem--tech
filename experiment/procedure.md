### Procedure
🧪 Experiment: Measurement of Cell Conductance of a Solution
Objective
To measure the conductance of a given electrolyte solution using a conductivity cell and calculate its specific conductance.

Apparatus and Materials Required
Conductivity cell (with platinum electrodes)

AC conductivity bridge or Wheatstone bridge (or a digital conductometer)

Ammeter (sensitive), Voltmeter

AC voltage source (to prevent polarization)

Electrolyte solution (e.g., NaCl, HCl)

Standard KCl solution (for calibration)

Beaker, wash bottle, and distilled water

### Procedure
1. Calibration of Cell Constant
Clean the conductivity cell with distilled water and dry it.

Fill the cell with standard KCl solution of known conductivity (e.g., 0.01 M KCl).

Connect the cell to the AC voltage source and measure:

Voltage (V) across the cell

Current (I) through the cell

Calculate conductance:

𝐺=I/V

 
Calculate cell constant (K):

𝐾=𝜅
known/G
 
where 
𝜅
known is the known conductivity of KCl.

2. Measurement of Unknown Solution Conductance
Wash the cell thoroughly and fill it with the electrolyte solution to be tested.

Apply the same AC voltage as before.

Measure the new current (I) and voltage (V).

Calculate new conductance:

𝐺=I/V
​
 
Use the previously determined cell constant (K) to calculate specific conductance (κ):

𝜅=K.G=K.I/V

​

✅ Precautions
Use AC current to avoid polarization at the electrodes.

Ensure clean electrodes for each measurement.

Calibrate the cell before measuring unknown solutions.

Handle electrical components with care.
